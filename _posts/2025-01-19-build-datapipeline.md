**Have you ever faced situations like these?**<br>
“I trained and deployed a model, but a week later, the data changed, and the performance dropped significantly.”<br>“I developed a new model version, but I can’t trace which data was used, how it was trained, or even under what conditions and by whom.”<br>“I’m familiar with CI/CD pipelines, so why is updating ML models so complicated?”

**The key to solving these operational challenges in managing machine learning models lies in building data pipelines and automated model management. Automating the end-to-end process—from periodic data collection and preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and validation, to deploying new model versions—makes AI projects significantly more robust.**<br><br>

## 1. What is a Data Pipeline?
### 1.1 Definition of a Data Pipeline
- In simple terms, a data pipeline is **“A process that automates every stage from data generation (collection) to processing (ETL/ELT), storage, analysis, and training.”** (c.f. ELT: Extract, Load, Transform)<br>
- For instance:
  - Collection: Extracting logs, sensor data, database records, etc.
  - Processing: Handling missing or anomalous data, format transformation, feature engineering, etc.
  - Storage: Data lakes, data warehouses, feature stores, etc.
  - Model Training: Periodically retraining models with new data.
  - Deployment: Transferring trained models to production environments.
  - Monitoring: Tracking model predictions, performance monitoring, and detecting data drift.
- The essence is automating all these processes so that, once set up, they can run periodically with minimal human intervention.<br>

### 1.2 Why is Automation Necessary?
- Humans dislike repetitive tasks! Manually running scripts daily at midnight might work for a while but will inevitably lead to lapses.
- Data volumes are growing, and changes are becoming more frequent. When data scales from thousands to millions or billions of records daily, manual handling becomes infeasible.
- Consistency is critical. If preprocessing changes with each model iteration, comparing versions becomes challenging.
- Faster iteration cycles. Regularly updating models to reflect fresh data demands an automated pipeline to accelerate the “idea → experiment → deployment” cycle.
<br><br>

## 2. What is Automated Model Management?
### 2.1 Model Versioning & Registry
- Just like version control in software, tracking versions of machine learning models is essential.
- Recording which dataset version, hyperparameters, and code snapshot were used for training makes rollback and comparisons much easier when issues arise.
- Tools like Model Registry (e.g., MLflow Model Registry, SageMaker Model Registry) are commonly used for this purpose.<br>

### 2.2 CI/CD + CT (Continuous Training)
- In software development, we have CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment); in machine learning, CT (Continuous Training) complements this.
  - CI/CD pipelines: Automate testing, building, validation, and deployment when model code changes.
  - CT pipelines: Periodically retrain models with new data or trigger retraining when data drift is detected, and deploy automatically if performance meets predefined thresholds.
- Fully automated systems seamlessly integrate data pipelines and model pipelines for end-to-end automation.<br>

### 2.3 Monitoring & Alerts
- Real-time monitoring of deployed models is crucial to ensure they perform as expected.
  - For example, alerts via Slack or email when predictions deviate beyond a certain range.
  - Triggering retraining upon detecting data distribution shifts (data drift).
  - These monitoring stages can also be automated within the pipeline.

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:
