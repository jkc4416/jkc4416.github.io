These days, most development and data science work assumes we have **internet access**. We download and install packages via Conda, Pip, etc. 

However, there are still barriers in the world called “**offline**.” In particular, if you’re working on a server with **strict security** that’s cut off from the outside world, you can’t freely install packages with Conda.

So, is there a way to take a **Miniconda virtual environment created on an online network** and move it **wholesale** to an **offline** network? 

Of course there is! Today, we’ll talk about how to do so in a way that’s fairly straightforward (although a bit fiddly at times).
<br><br>

## 1. What We'll Cover in Advance
1. **Installing Miniconda & Creating an Environment**: We’ll set up a new virtual environment on a clean, lightweight Miniconda installation.  
2. **Installing Needed Packages in the Environment**: We’ll make sure to pre-install everything needed for offline use.  
3. **Archiving the Environment**: We’ll use tools like `conda-pack` (or similar) to package up the entire environment.  
4. **Copying & Unpacking on the Offline Network**: We’ll bring the resulting archive file to the offline network via external media or network paths, and restore the configuration.  
5. **Using the Virtual Environment Offline**: Finally, we’ll check that we can activate the environment (e.g., `conda activate my_env`) and use it even when totally offline.

Ready? Grab a cup of coffee and let’s get going.
<br><br>

## 2. Installing Miniconda: A Lightweight & Lovely Start
Chances are, you’ve already installed Miniconda (or Anaconda). If not, let’s quickly review how.
1. **Download Miniconda**  
   - From the [official Miniconda page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), pick the installer for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  
   - Of course, in an offline environment, even this can be tricky. So you’ll need to grab it **on an online system first**.
2. **Run the Installation**  
   - On Windows, just run the `.exe` and follow the installer wizard.  
   - On Linux/macOS, run the `.sh` file in your terminal (e.g., `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`) to complete the install.
3. **Path Configuration**  
   - After installation, open a new terminal/command prompt and check whether `conda --version` prints the expected result.  
   - If there’s a problem, you may need to add `miniconda3/bin` or `miniconda3/condabin` (under your home directory) to `$PATH` or the system PATH.
Once installed, you can exclaim, “Great, Miniconda is ready to go!”
<br><br>

## 3. Creating a Virtual Environment: The Name & Packages You Want
### 3.1 Basic Conda Environment Creation
It’s good practice to maintain separate virtual environments for each new project to avoid package conflicts. Let’s create a new environment with:

```bash
conda create -n my_offline_env python=3.9
```

Here, `my_offline_env` is the environment name. Feel free to choose your own, but note that I’ll keep using `my_offline_env` in the explanations below. Once it runs, you’ll have a minimal environment with Python 3.9.
<br>

### 3.2 Installing Packages
Because you’ll be offline later, you need to install every package you’ll need **in advance**. For example:
```bash
conda activate my_offline_env
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

Or if you need some packages from PyPI:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

_Note_: Perfectly identifying every dependency can be a headache. Make sure to install everything you need in one go. (But if you just “install all the latest versions!” your environment may get huge, so be selective.)

Now use `conda list` or `pip list` to confirm that everything you need is there. If you’re satisfied—“Yes, the packages I want are all installed!”—then proceed.

<br><br>

## 4. Prepping the Move Offline: Archiving the Environment

### 4.1 Using `conda-pack`
One of the most common approaches is **`conda-pack`**, which packages (archives) an entire Miniconda (or Anaconda) environment into a single file.

1. **Installing `conda-pack`**  
   - In your active environment (or the base environment), run `conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack` to install.
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack
    ```
   
2. **Performing the Archive**  
   - For instance:  
     ```bash
     conda pack -n my_offline_env -o my_offline_env.tar.gz
     ```  
   - `-n` specifies the environment name; `-o` specifies the output filename. This creates an archive (`.tar.gz`) containing everything from `my_offline_env`.

Once it’s done, you’ll find a (potentially large) file named `my_offline_env.tar.gz` in the same directory. That’s the precious cargo you’ll be taking to the offline network.
<br>

### 4.2 Alternative Method: Folder Copy + YML Export

If for some reason you can’t use `conda-pack`, there’s another method:

1. **Generate Environment YML**: `conda env export -n my_offline_env > my_offline_env.yml`  
2. **Copy the Entire Folder**: Copy the root folder of the environment (e.g., `~/miniconda3/envs/my_offline_env`)  
3. **On the Offline Network**: Possibly restore with `conda env create -f my_offline_env.yml --offline`

However, you can run into missing caches or dependencies, especially if the OS differs. 

_So **`conda-pack`** is generally more stable and simpler; we recommend it whenever possible._
<br><br>

## 5. Moving to the Offline Network: USB? External HDD? Company Intranet?
### 5.1 Transfer Methods
Now for the big step: “moving” your environment. How you do this depends on **your specific IT setup**:
- **USB Flash Drive or External HDD**: The most common approach.  
- **Corporate Secure Network**: If you have a secure drive that the offline system can access, you can copy it through that.  
- **CD/DVD**: A bit old-school, but hey, it might still happen.  
- **Compliance with Security Policies**: Always follow your organization’s rules. If “No USB allowed,” coordinate with your security team to find an approved method.
<br>

### 5.2 Checking File Integrity (Optional)

If the file is huge, there’s a risk of data corruption. Compute a **SHA256 or MD5 hash** on the online side, then verify it in the offline environment:

```bash
# On the online side
sha256sum my_offline_env.tar.gz
# Produces a hash

# On the offline side
sha256sum my_offline_env.tar.gz
# Check if the hash matches
```

This helps confirm “No damage occurred in transit.”

<br><br>

## 6. Unpacking (Restoring) on the Offline Network

### 6.1 You Still Need Miniconda on the Target Machine

Even if it’s offline, you need a local installation of Miniconda or Anaconda so that **conda** can recognize the environment. If you haven’t installed it yet (and you have the installer `.sh`, `.exe` etc.), do so now on the offline network.
<br>

### 6.2 Extracting the Archive

Assuming you now have `my_offline_env.tar.gz` on the offline machine, let’s unzip it. Suppose you move it into `~/offline_envs`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/offline_envs
cd ~/offline_envs
tar -zxvf /path/to/my_offline_env.tar.gz
```

If the above command doesn't work, don't be frustrated and try the command below.

```bash
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/envs/my_offline_env
tar -xzf my_offline_env.tar.gz -C $CONDA_PREFIX/envs/my_offline_env
```

Extraction should produce a directory called `my_offline_env` (or something similar, possibly under an `envs` folder).
<br>

### 6.3 Running the `conda-pack` Script to Adjust Paths (Important)

When you use `conda-pack`, the environment might contain **hard-coded absolute paths**. To fix this, you typically need to run the `activate_this.sh` or `conda-unpack` script that `conda-pack` provided.

- If you used `conda-pack`, after unzipping, run something like:
  ```bash
  ./bin/conda-unpack
  ```

  If the above command doesn't work, don't be frustrated and try the command below.
  ```bash
  cd $CONDA_PREFIX/envs/my_offline_env
  conda-unpack
  ```


  - This will rewrite internal references and fix up any path issues.
  - Afterward, you can use the environment in this folder without problems.

If you skip this step and just run `python`, some packages might not work correctly.
<br>

### 6.4 Activating the Environment

To use the environment, do:

```bash
# Assuming Miniconda is installed
conda activate ~/offline_envs/my_offline_env

# If the above command doesn't work, please try this command!
conda activate my_offline_env
```
- On Windows, it might be `C:\offline_envs\my_offline_env\Scripts\activate.bat`.
- Now check `python --version` or `conda list` to confirm you see the same packages you had online.
<br><br>


## 7. Cautions for Operating in an Offline Environment

1. **No Package Updates**: You can’t run `conda update` or `pip install --upgrade` without internet. If you need a newer version, you must reconstruct the environment on the online side and copy again.  
2. **Changing the Path**: If you unzip into a different path, don’t forget to run `conda-unpack` (or the relevant fix script) again. Otherwise, you may run into path conflicts.  
3. **Platform Compatibility**: If your online environment was built on Windows but your offline environment is Linux, the environment likely won’t work. OS and architecture must match.
  - Based on my experience, issues often arise due to package path conflicts when using different operating systems.
4. **Storage Space**: If your environment is huge, `my_offline_env.tar.gz` can be multiple gigabytes. Ensure your offline machine has enough disk space!
<br><br>

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1. “Can’t I just copy the entire folder without `conda-pack`?”

- Technically yes, but the environment can break due to absolute path references, OS differences, and more. `conda-pack` provides scripts to solve these problems automatically—much cleaner.

### Q2. “Why not just create a new environment offline and install packages there?”

- That would require manually acquiring all `.tar.bz2` or `.whl` files for every package, including dependencies—often dozens or hundreds. It’s far easier to take a completed environment from online.
  > I’ve had plenty of experience with this task… perhaps too much. Let’s just say it’s a memory I’d rather not revisit—endless hours of mind-numbing work, sitting in a freezing server room, only to walk away with a cold as my souvenir. Truly, the stuff of nightmares!

### Q3. “What if my Miniconda versions differ between online and offline?”

- Usually it’s still okay, but it’s more reliable if they’re the same or at least close in version number.

### Q4. “My environment is too big. How do I shrink it?”

- Uninstall unnecessary packages, or only install the truly essential ones.  
- For instance, you can opt for CPU-only builds if you don’t need GPU support—those are often smaller.
<br><br>

## 9. Conclusion: Small Effort, Big Convenience
We just took a **deep dive** into how to create a Miniconda environment online and then copy it to an offline environment. The bottom line is that once you learn these steps:

- You can do Python tasks (like data preprocessing, model inference, etc.) smoothly on **an offline server**.  
- You avoid repetitive installations and “dependency hell.”  
- You know your environment “already has everything you need,” so you can just use it confidently.

Yes, the steps (packing, copying, unpacking, etc.) can be a bit of a hassle, but you’ll get used to them. Mastering this skill might even earn you kudos from coworkers—someone who can handle offline environments must be “the real deal!”
<br><br>

## 10. An Extra Tip: Setting Up an Offline Repository
If you want to go bigger, some organizations maintain a **private Conda repository** (mirror) inside the company. That way, each environment can simply `conda install mypackage` from that local mirror. But that involves setting up a special server and syncing all packages, so it’s more of a large-scale solution.

If you only need “just one environment,” the approach explained above is simplest.

# Final Wrap-Up
This blog post was inspired by my own experience of applying an AI model I developed to a manufacturing environment. 

Manufacturing sites, due to strict corporate security policies, are often disconnected from external internet access, making even simple tasks like installing packages a challenge. 

While these measures are necessary to protect sensitive data, they can create major hurdles for engineers and researchers trying to implement cutting-edge solutions in such environments.  

I know I’m not alone in facing these issues—many of you in similar industries likely share this struggle. That’s why I wanted to document my experience and share practical tips to make the process a little smoother. 

If you’re dealing with USB drives, air-gapped servers, or dependency chaos, I hope this post saves you time and frustration. Let’s tackle these challenges together and prove that innovation thrives even in the toughest conditions! 😊

According to the above blog post, by copying a Miniconda environment to an offline network, you can confidently run Python workloads inside a **strict security** environment. Archive your environment using `conda-pack`, transfer it over USB or a secure network path, unpack it offline, run `conda-unpack` to fix paths, and you’re good to go—**that** is the gist of today’s tutorial!

If you’re planning to run more Python-based projects in an offline setting, learning these steps will save you a lot of time. Hopefully you’ll now have the confidence to say, **“No internet? That’s okay—I still use Conda!”**
