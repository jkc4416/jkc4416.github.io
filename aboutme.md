My name is HamIT. Nice to meet you!

### My story
Hello! 🐹 I’m a fluffy, round ball of energy—imagine a hamster who spends more time tinkering with code than running on a wheel. With a passion for IT and artificial intelligence, I’m on a mission to explore the digital universe one byte at a time (while occasionally nibbling on sunflower seeds for inspiration). My expertise includes running neural networks faster than I run in my hamster wheel and troubleshooting with unparalleled persistence. If you’re into innovation, let’s roll together—hamster style! 🛞✨
